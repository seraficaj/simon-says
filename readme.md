# Dialpad Dance Game

## Getting started:

Play the game online here at: https://seraficaj.github.io/DialpadDanceGame/, or download it your computer and open the "index.html" file.
- To begin the game, click on the New Game button
- Watch the buttons flash in a sequence
- Then, it will be your turn to repeat the order by clicking on the buttons.
- If you repeat the sequence perfectly, you get 1 point and another button is added to the memorized sequence.
- If you click on the wrong button, you have to start all over again and memorize a new sequence!
